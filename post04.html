                        <p>Architecture history podcasts rely heavily on the linguistic mode â€“ choice of vocabulary, style of speech, and how this speech is delivered act to appeal to ethos and pathos.</p>

                        <p><em>99% Invisible's</em> Usonia 1, <em>A History of Architecture's</em> Walter Gropius and the Bauhaus, and <em>About Buildings + Cities's</em> "Have Formwork, Will Travel" all use vocabulary that is accessible but still formal. The vocabulary used strays away from difficult to understand jargon, and when a potentially confusing word is used, a definition is provided. This quality fits the genre expectations, helping the three podcasts to successfully fulfill their rhetorical purpose.</p>

                        <p>All three podcasts have differing styles of speech. Both <em>99% Invisible</em> and <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> have more than one speaker per episode, but the tone amongst the speakers for each podcast is distinct. The hosts of <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> interact with each other in a conversational manner reminiscent of a talk show. This style of interaction gives <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> a more casual feeling, but it still works well given that much of the audience is made up of non-professionals and the primary purpose is to provide entertainment. It also allows for more frequent appeals pathos, since the hosts are able to joke around with each other.</p>

                        <p>The speakers for <em>99% Invisible</em> use a journalistic style. They trade off on talking points and only speak directly to each other during specific portions of the podcast set aside for interviewing. The linguistic delivery style of <em>99% Invisible</em> adds to the show's ethos, since this more formal style makes the hosts seem more credible. While the linguistic style isn't so academic as to alienate the podcast from its primary purpose of entertainment, this helps fulfill the podcast's secondary purpose of educating the audience.</p>

                        <p>The host of <em>A History of Architecture</em> speaks in a scripted manner, similar to the journalistic style of <em>99% Invisible</em> but even more formal. This style of speech has the feeling of an academic lecture or an audiobook of an academic subject. The tone indicates a formality that is more appropriate for an audience whose main goal is to gain knowledge rather than be entertained. In this way, this episode of <em>A History of Architecture</em> has neglected part of its audience and has failed to fulfill its primary rhetorical purpose in favor of its secondary rhetorical purpose.</p>

                        <p>The podcasts use varying methods of how citations/supporting evidence, which are appeals to logos, are delivered. "Usonia 1" contains in podcast citations delivered by the hosts as well as experts in the field. Clips of Frank Lloyd Wright talking about himself and his work are also used (Audio 3). The choice to deliver information about Wright through experts in the field and through Wright's own voice adds to the podcast's appeal to ethos. <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> and <em>A History of Architecture</em> both deliver this information via the hosts of the podcasts instead of through directly speaking with experts or utilizing audio clips of the person of interest. Referencing these citations adds to the appeal to ethos, but in a lesser manner compared to the delivery method used by <em>99% Invisible</em>.</p>
