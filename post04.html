                        <p>Architecture history podcasts rely heavily on the linguistic mode – choice of vocabulary, style of speech, and how this speech is delivered act to appeal to ethos, pathos, and logos.</p>

                        <p><em>99% Invisible's</em> Usonia 1, <em>A History of Architecture's</em> Walter Gropius and the Bauhaus, and <em>About Buildings + Cities's</em> "Have Formwork, Will Travel" all use vocabulary that is accessible but still formal. The vocabulary used strays away from difficult to understand jargon, and when a potentially confusing word is used, a definition is provided. This quality fits the genre expectations, helping the three podcasts to successfully fulfill their rhetorical purpose.</p>

                        <p>All three podcasts have differing styles of speech. Both <em>99% Invisible</em> and <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> have more than one speaker per episode, but the tone amongst the speakers for each podcast is distinct. While the hosts of <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> interact with each other in a conversational manner reminiscent of a talk show. This style of interaction gives About Buildings + Cities a more casual feeling, but it still works well given that much of the audience is made up of non-professionals and the primary purpose is to provide entertainment. </p>

                        <p>The speakers for <em>99% Invisible</em> use a journalistic style. They trade off on talking points, and only speak directly to each other during specific portions of the podcast set aside for interviewing. The linguistic delivery style of <em>99% Invisible</em>, on the otherhand, adds to the show's ethos, since this more formal style makes the hosts seem more credible. While the linguistic style isn't so academic as to alienate the podcast from its primary purpose of entertainment, this helps fulfill the podcast's secondary purpose of educating the audience.</p>

                        <p>The host of <em>A History of Architecture</em> speaks in a scripted manner. This style of speech has the feeling of an academic lecture or an audiobook of an academic subject. The tone indicates a formality that is more appropriate for an audience whose main goal is to gain knowledge rather than be entertained. In this way, this episode of <em>A History of Architecture</em> has neglected part of its audience and has failed to fulfill its rhetorical goal.</p>

                        <p>The podcasts use varying methods of how citations/supporting evidence, appeals to logos, are delivered. "Usonia 1" contains in podcast citations as well as audio clips of experts speaking about Frank Lloyd Wright. Clips of Frank Lloyd Wright talking about himself and his work are also used (Audio 3). The choice to deliver information about Wright through experts in the field and through Wright's own voice adds to the podcast's appeal to ethos. <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> and <em>A History of Architecture</em> do not contain audio of the experts or subjects themselves, but they do reference them when speaking of their topics. This adds to the appeal to ethos, but in a lesser manner.</p>

                        <div class="center">
                            <audio controls controlsList="nodownload">

                        <p>Again, <em>99% Invisible</em> can be used as prime example of an architecture history podcast successfully fulfilling its rhetorical purpose. Language and delivery work in harmony with the other rhetorical devices to create a podcast that best fulfills its rhetorical purpose. Its use of professional, but not overly complex, vocabulary allows the podcast to maintain an educated yet approachable image.</p>
