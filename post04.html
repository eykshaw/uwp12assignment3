                    <p>The linguistic mode is the most important factor for all three podcast episodes. Architecture history podcasts rely heavily on their appeals to ethos through the linguistic mode – the information that is presented is meant to be factual, a reflection of architecture’s logical and perhaps mathematical nature. One way that the podcasts do this is through choice of vocabulary and patterns of speech. Including content such as references to professionals within the field or audio clips from the subject of the podcast also appeal to the listeners’ ethos. </p>

                    <p>In 99% Invisible’s Usonia, the hosts use vocabulary that is accessible but still formal. The vocabulary used strays away from difficult to understand jargon, and when a word specific to architecture is used, a definition is provided. A History of Architecture’s Le Corbusier and the Bauhaus and About Buildings + Cities’ Have Formwork, Will Travel both use a similar level of vocabulary. A History of Architecture has a slight tendency to use more formal language, but it is still not on a level that makes it difficult for someone who is interested in architecture to understand. </p>
                    
                    <div class="quote">[Quotation from A History of Architecture]</div>

                    <p>Both 99% Invisible and About Buildings + Cities have more than one speaker per episode, but the tone amongst the speakers for each podcast is different. While About Buildings + CIties interact with each other in a conversational manner reminiscent of a talk show, the speakers for 99% Invisible are less conversational. They trade off on talking points, and only seem to speak directly to each other during specific portions of the podcast set aside for interviewing. This style of interaction gives About Buildings + Cities a more casual feeling, but it still works well given that much of the audience for this genre of podcast is made up of non-professionals. </p>

                    <p>All three podcasts contain references to experts within the field. Usonia 1 contains in podcast citations as well as audio clips of experts speaking about Frank Lloyd Wright. Clips of Frank Lloyd Wright talking about himself and his work are also used. About Buildings + Cities and A History of Architecture do not contain audio of the experts themselves, but they do reference them when speaking of their topics. </p>

                    <p>Again, 99% Invisible can be used as an optimal example of how language and content work in harmony with the other rhetorical devices to create a podcast that best fulfills its rhetorical purpose. Its use of professional but not overly complex vocabulary allows the podcast to maintain an educated but approachable image. </p>
