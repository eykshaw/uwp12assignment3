                    <p>Life imitates art? Art imitates life? Boe constantly takes the form of a spectacular Fibonacci spiral, and I wonder how he knows to do this. The golden ratio is here. Cats are fantastically mathematical. When a cat falls from up high, it instinctually flips itself in midair to land on its feet. This allows them to absorb the shock of the fall into their legs and through their body (instead of turning into a pancake on the ground).</p>

                    <p>Cats have floating clavicle bones, which allows them to squeeze themselves through extremely tight spaces. So really, the width of a space that they can fit through is limited by the size of their head (assuming they’re not too fat). Humans, on the other hand, have clavicles which are very much attached. The best way for most of us to get through a tight space is to turn sideways, since we don’t have crazy, floating collar bones.</p>

                    <p>Boe, like most cats, has a mind of his own. He uses his flexibility for evil most times; he greatly enjoys slipping through the tiny crack of the partially opened front door to escape into the great unknown. Nonetheless, having Boe has been a fantastic experience. He is by far the cuddliest out of my three current cats, and he doesn’t meow incessantly like his brother, Mr. Bennett. Here’s to Boe and his wily ways.</p>
