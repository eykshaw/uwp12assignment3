                    <p>Podcasting is a medium unique to the rise of the internet. [definition of a podcast] This medium contains many genres, from comedy to true crime. In this series of blog posts, we will look at the different aspects of architecture history podcasts. When analyzing the architecture history podcast genre, we should note that the intended audience contains a range of people; it is composed of architects, architecture enthusiasts, and people who are casually interested in architectural design. This podcast genre’s primary purpose is to provide entertainment to the listener. Its secondary purpose is to educate the audience on architectural history and concepts.</p>

                    <p>This podcast genre contains a great range in the production of the podcasts themselves. Some podcasts are part of a larger company, which allows access to more editing and producing assistance, while some are independent projects and are edited and produced by a single person or just a few people. In this blog series, we will cover the following three podcasts: 99% Invisible, A History of Architecture, and About Buildings + Cities. The following episodes will be used as examples: 99% Invisible’s Usonia 1, A History of Architecture’s Walter Gropius and the Bauhaus, and About Buildings + Cities’ Have Formwork, Will Travel will be compared and contrasted. All three episodes address prominent modern architects. </p>

                    <p>What makes this type of podcast successful? How do they keep listeners engaged? How well do certain podcasts do this? These answers will be addressed in the new three posts.</p>
