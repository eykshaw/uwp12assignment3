                        <p>Podcasting is an ever growing entertainment medium, unique to the rise of the internet. Rebecca Mead of <em>The New Yorker</em> (2018) defines a podcast as "on-demand audio that a listener can download and play while commuting or exercising or, given the right equipment, showering." This medium contains many genres, but in this series of blog posts, we will look at the architecture history podcast genre.</p>

                        <p>The intended audience contains a range of people; it is composed of professional architects, architecture students, and people who simply have an interest in architectural design. This podcast genreâ€™s primary purpose is to provide entertainment to the listener. Its secondary purpose is to educate the audience on architectural history and concepts.</p>

                        <p>In this analysis, we must acknowledge that this podcast genre contains a great range in the production of the podcast itself. Some podcasts are part of a larger network, which allows access to more editing and producing assistance, while some are independent projects, edited and produced by a single person or just a few people. Our analysis will discuss the various qualities of each podcast without accounting for this variable.</p>

                        <p>In this blog series, we will cover the following three podcasts: <em>99% Invisible</em>, <em>A History of Architecture</em>, and <em>About Buildings + Cities</em>. The following episodes will be used as examples: <em>99% Invisibleâ€™s</em> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/246-usonia-1/id394775318?i=1000380931881&mt=2">"Usonia 1"</a>, <em>A History of Architectureâ€™s</em> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/009-walter-gropius-and-the-bauhaus-part-1/id959437457?i=1000338213853&mt=2">"Walter Gropius and the Bauhaus"</a>, and <em>About Buildings + Citiesâ€™</em> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/26-le-corbusier-1-have-formwork-will-travel/id1147205326?i=1000394756003&mt=2">"Have Formwork, Will Travel"</a>. All three episodes address prominent modern architects.</p>

                        <p>Mead (2018) says "podcasts are designed to take up time, rather than to be checked, scanned, and rushed through." How well a podcast fulfills the expectations of its genre is essential in maintaining an intimate relationship with the listener. The next three posts will explore how this is achieved through the use of the visual (cover art), aural (sound and music), and linguistic (language and delivery) modes of communication in relation to appeals to the listener's ethos, pathos, and logos.</p>
