                    <p>The linguistic mode is the most important factor for all three podcast episodes. Architecture history podcasts rely heavily on their appeals to ethos through the linguistic mode – the information that is presented is meant to be factual, a reflection of architecture’s logical and perhaps mathematical nature. One way that the podcasts do this is through choice of vocabulary and patterns of speech. Including content such as references to professionals within the field or audio clips from the subject of the podcast also appeal to the listeners’ ethos.</p>

                    <p>Although podcasts mainly utilize the aural mode of communication, the first thing that a listener encounters is the podcast’s cover art. Because of this, the visual mode of communication has a very important role. It is important for the cover art to be representative of the podcast itself. For architecture history podcasts, it is also expected that the cover art be well designed.</p>
