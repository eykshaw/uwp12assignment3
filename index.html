                    <p>Today I found my cat sitting on the floor of my room like a loaf of bread. I’ve never seen her eat bread, so I’m not sure how she adopted this particular look. She has, however, stolen a corndog from my plate before. A vegetarian corndog, no less. I do not believe that cats typically have an affinity for tofu, and this happenstance has left my utterly confused. It’s been over a decade and I’m still scratching my head over it.</p>

                    <p>There are two types of cats in this world: the friendly, sociable cat who takes advantage of their charismatic nature to get what they want; the skittish, distrusting cat who hides away in fear and glares at those who pass by. Mr. Bennett is the latter. It’s a curious situation, really, as he started out as a very adventurous kitten. He hated staying in one place and was the first to escape the confines of the box in which he and his littermates were originally kept.</p>

                    <p>Life imitates art? Art imitates life? Boe constantly takes the form of a spectacular Fibonacci spiral, and I wonder how he knows to do this. The golden ratio is here. Cats are fantastically mathematical. When a cat falls from up high, it instinctually flips itself in midair to land on its feet. This allows them to absorb the shock of the fall into their legs and through their body (instead of turning into a pancake on the ground).</p>
