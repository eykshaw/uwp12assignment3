                    <p>The aural mode of communication one of the most prominent of a podcast. Due to the purely sound based experience, podcasts have a great potential to utilize elements such as music, sound clips, and even binaural sound to create a specific experience. </p>

                    <p>The podcast 99% Invisible is able to utilize a great number of aural elements. It should be noted that this is possible because of 99% Invisible’s team of multiple editors and producers. One of the notable uses of the aural mode of communication that 99% Invisible utilizes is the use of background music. While the host, Roman Mars, and the reporter is speaking, music plays quietly in the background. This adds another layer of sound and appeals to the listener’s ethos by giving the perception of a more well produced podcast. Further, the music reflects the general mood of the narrative at any given point, appealing to the listener’s pathos.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>In contrast, the other two podcast episodes do not utilize background music throughout their audio content. About Buildings + Cities’ Have Formwork, Will Travel uses a clip of Beethoven’s Ode to Joy as background music to the beginning of the podcast. It compliments a quote from Le Corbusier that describes his success in building the New York World’s Center. This pairing is purposeful and successfully reflects the tone of the quotation, appealing to the listener’s ethos. Though this use of music is successful for this portion of the podcast, it would improve the podcast's effectiveness by repeating this method throughout the episode. Walter Gropius and the Bauhaus does not use any music, background or otherwise, in the production of its audio content. </p>

                    </div>

                    <p>These two podcast episodes also utilize differences in the speaker(s)’s pitch to add variety to the audio. The two episodes have two speakers, each with different voices. 99% Invisible’s Roman Mars and Avery Trufelman have significantly contrasting voices – Roman Mars’ voice is deep, whereas Avery Trufelman’s is higher. While the hosts’ of About Buildings + Cities have voices that are less contrasting, the slight difference between the two still allows the listener to detect a variation in pitch and tone. The episode of A History of Architecture, on the other hand, has a single host, so this variety is not present. </p>

                    <p>Of the three, 99% Invisible most successfully utilizes aural aspects to create an engaging listening experience with a variety of sounds. Its use of background music coupled with the pitch and tone contrast of the two speakers work to keep the listener engaged, while the other two podcasts lack the mood directing music and the speaker variation (to this extent). </p>
