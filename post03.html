                        <p>The aural mode of communication is one of the most prominent aspects of an architecture history podcast. Due to the (usually) exclusively audio based experience, podcasts have a great potential to utilize elements such as music, different speakers, and even binaural sound to create a specific experience.</p>

                        <p><em>99% Invisible's</em> "Usonia 1" utilizes several aural elements. One notable use of the aural mode of communication is the background music. While the hosts are speaking, music plays in the background (Audio 1). This adds another layer of sound and appeals to the listenerâ€™s ethos by giving the perception of a more well produced podcast. Further, the music reflects the mood of the narrative at any given moment, appealing to the listenerâ€™s pathos.</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>In contrast, the other two podcast episodes do not utilize background music throughout their audio content. <em>About Buildings + Cities'</em> "Have Formwork, Will Travel" uses background music for quotations. One notable instance is when a clip of Beethovenâ€™s <em>Ode to Joy</em> is used as background music to the beginning of the podcast (Audio 2). It compliments a quote from Le Corbusier that describes his success in building the New York Worldâ€™s Center. This pairing is purposeful and successfully reflects the tone of the quotation, appealing to the listenerâ€™s pathos. Though the use of music is successful for these portions of the podcast, it could improve the podcast's effectiveness by repeating this method throughout other parts of the episode. <em>A History of Architecture's</em> "Walter Gropius and the Bauhaus" does not use any music, background or otherwise, in the the podcast outside of the intro and outro.</p>

                        <p><em>99% Invisible</em> and <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> also utilize differences in the two speakers' voices to add variety to the audio. <em>99% Invisible's</em> Roman Mars and Avery Trufelman have significantly contrasting voices â€“ Marsâ€™ voice is deep and Trufelmanâ€™s is higher (Audio 3). While the hosts of <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> have voices that are less contrasting, the slight difference between the two still allows the listener to detect a variation (Audio 4). This acts as an appeal to the audience's pathos by providing more points of interest and keeping the listener from becoming bored.</p>

                        <p><em>A History of Architecture</em>, on the other hand, has a single host but still makes use of binaural techniques to create variety in the audio. Instead of using different voices, quotations are projected into one ear instead of both, creating a contrast between the host's speech and that of the quotations (Audio 5). This also appeals to the audience's pathos by keeping the listener from becoming bored. This method only works if the listener is using earbuds or headphones, whereas using completely different voices, such as in <em>99% Invisible</em> and <em>About Buildings + Cities</em>, is perceptible regardless of how the audience listens to the episode.</p>

                        <p>Of the three, <em>99% Invisible</em> most successfully utilizes aural aspects to create an engaging listening experience with a variety of sounds. Its use of background music coupled with the pitch and tone contrast of the two speakers work to keep the listener engaged and entertained, fulfilling its rhetorical purpose.</p>
