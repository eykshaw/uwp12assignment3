                    <p>Today I found my cat sitting on the floor of my room like a loaf of bread. I’ve never seen her eat bread, so I’m not sure how she adopted this particular look. She has, however, stolen a corndog from my plate before. A vegetarian corndog, no less. I do not believe that cats typically have an affinity for tofu, and this happenstance has left my utterly confused. It’s been over a decade and I’m still scratching my head over it.</p> 

                    <p>Tribble is a Himalayan/Norwegian forest cat mix and is on the larger end of the average cat, and she’s named after the small, fuzzy creatures from Star Trek. This was fitting when she was a young, playful, ridiculously fluffy kitten, but now she’s lost quite a bit of her fuzz. Her fuzz rating has been reduced to 10/10 from her previous 15/10. Despite this, she is still a good cat, as all cats are.</p>

                    <p>Of all the cats that I’ve owned in my lifetime, she’s probably the calmest one. She also makes an excellent portrait subject, as shown by the painting above.</p>
