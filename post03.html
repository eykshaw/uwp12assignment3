                        <p>The aural mode of communication is one of the most prominent aspects of an architecture history podcast. Due to the (usually) exclusively audio based experience, podcasts are able to utilize elements such as music, different speakers, and even binaural sound to create a specific experience.</p>

                        <h4>Background Music</h4>

                        <p><em>99% Invisible's</em> "Usonia 1" utilizes several aural elements. One notable use of the aural mode of communication is the background music. While the hosts are speaking, music plays in the background (Audio 1). This adds another layer of sound and appeals to ethos by giving the perception of a more well produced podcast. The music also reflects the mood of the narrative, appealing to pathos.</p>

                            <audio controls controlsList="nodownload">
                                <source src="audio/99pisambgm.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

                        </div>

                        <p><em>About Buildings + Cities'</em> "Have Formwork, Will Travel" uses background music, but only for quotations. One notable instance is when a clip of Beethovenâ€™s <em>Ode to Joy</em> is used as background music to the beginning of the podcast (Audio 2). It compliments a quote from Le Corbusier that describes his success in building the New York Worldâ€™s Center. This pairing is purposeful and successfully reflects the tone of the quotation, appealing to pathos. Though the use of music is successful for these portions of the podcast, it could improve the podcast's effectiveness by repeating this method throughout other parts of the episode. <em>A History of Architecture's</em> "Walter Gropius and the Bauhaus" does not use any music, background or otherwise, in the the podcast outside of the intro and outro. This lack of any background music is out of place for the genre, weakening the podcast's relationship with the audience.</p>

                        <h4>Speakers' Voices</h4>

                        <p><em>99% Invisible</em> and <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> also utilize differences in the two speakers' voices to add variety to the audio. <em>99% Invisible's</em> Roman Mars and Avery Trufelman have significantly contrasting voices â€“ Marsâ€™ voice is deep and Trufelmanâ€™s is higher (Audio 3). While the hosts of <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> have voices that are less contrasting, the slight difference between the two still allows the listener to detect a variation (Audio 4). This acts as an appeal to pathos by providing more points of interest and keeping the listener from becoming bored.</p>

                        <h4>Binaural Audio</h4>

                        <p><em>A History of Architecture</em>, on the other hand, has a single host. It makes use of binaural audio, or audio that is perceived as three dimensional (FÃ©ret, 2017), to create variety. Instead of using different voices, the sound of a quotation appears to come from either the left or right instead of all directions, creating a contrast between the host's speech and that of the quotation (Audio 5). This also appeals to pathos as described above. Because the context in which this genre would be interacted with is usually individual, it can be assumed that many listeners would use earbuds or headphones, making this a suitable method for aural communication. Using completely different voices, such as in <em>99% Invisible</em> and <em>About Buildings + Cities</em>, is perceptible regardless of how the audience listens to the episode.</p>
