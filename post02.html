                    <p>Although podcasts mainly utilize the aural mode of communication, the first thing that a listener encounters is the podcast’s cover art. Because of this, the visual mode of communication has a very important role. It is important for the cover art to be representative of the podcast itself. For architecture history podcasts, it is also expected that the cover art be well designed. </p>

                    <p>Architecture history podcasts generally share several important qualities: they reference the topic of the podcast (architecture), they have a simplistic color palette, and they include important information using text. </p>

                    <br />

                    <p>Referencing architecture appeals to the viewer’s logos, acting as a visual citation. It also helps build the podcast’s credibility, which appeals to the audience’s ethos. The three podcasts all contain references to architecture, each to a different degree of success. 99% Invisible’s cover art does this through the use of a visual grid. Many associate grids and order with architecture (SRC), so integrating this into the logo helps orient the viewer towards the content of the podcast. A History of Architecture uses geometric diagrams, playing on the technical associations that architecture is prone to have. The cover art for About Buildings + Cities uses a literal approach by using an image of a building as its background. </p>

                    <p>The first two examples use broader references, while About Buildings + Cities’ reference is very specific. Although 99% Invisible’s reference is arguably the most broad, it is still successful. A History of Architecture, on the other hand, runs the risk of referencing a different genre altogether. Although architecture is associated with geometry and mathematics, a viewer could accidentally mistake this cover art to belong to a podcast about math. </p>

                    <p>All three podcasts have a fairly limited color palette. Both 99% Invisible and About Buildings + Cities use a black and white palette with a yellow accent to create a more dynamic graphic appearance and to emphasize important information. A History of Architecture uses green as its main color with accents of orange and blue. The accent colors are used for the geometric graphics to draw the viewer’s attention to the middle of the cover art. 99% Invisible’s use of color is the most successful because of how it is used in relation to the grid. One square out of one hundred  is colored, making it stand out. This references the podcast’s own name as 99% of the squares are black with just 1% yellow. </p>

                    <p>Each podcast displays important information on the cover art. 99% Invisible and About Buildings + Cities show the names of their podcasts, while A History of Architecture shows the podcast’s website URL. Of the three, 99% Invisible is the most successful in integrating the podcast name into the graphic, as the letters are incorporated into the grid pattern of the graphic. A History of Architecture chooses not to display the podcast name itself, which might be confusing to the viewer if they did not already know what the podcast is called – for this reason, A History of Architecture is the least successful in utilizing key text in its cover art. </p>

                    <p>Of the three podcasts, 99% Invisible’s cover art design is the most successful in meeting the expectations of the genre. The three main aspects (architectural reference, color, and text) come together to create a cohesive design that references the topic of the podcast and easily identifies what the podcast is. The cohesive design of 99% Invisible’s cover art appeals to the listener’s ethos by making the podcast seem more trustworthy in how it will discuss design topics. </p>
