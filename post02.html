                        <p>Although podcasts mainly utilize the aural mode of communication, the first thing that a listener encounters is the cover art. Because of this, the visual mode of communication has a very important role. It acts to establish a trustworthy image of the podcast by appealing to ethos.</p>

                        <p>This aspect of the podcast uses the concept of forecasting, which is defined as what is expected based on prior knowledge and experiences (Hilligoss et al, 2002). In order to best fit the genre's conventions, the cover art should reflect what the audience expects to see in an architecture/architecture history related podcast.</p>

                        <p>Architecture history podcast cover art generally shares several important qualities: text displaying the podcast title, visual references to architecture, and a minimalist design. These can be addressed on three levels as outlined by art historian Panofsky: preiconographic, iconographic, and iconological (Serafini, 2011) respectively.</p>

                        <div class="col3 figure">
                            <img src="images/coverart_ahoa.jpg" alt="ahoa cover art">
                            <figcaption>Figure 2. <em>A History of Architecture's</em> Cover Art</figcaption>
                        </div>

                        <div class="col3 figure">
                            <img src="images/coverart_abc.jpg" alt="abc cover art">
                            <figcaption>Figure 3. <em>About Buildings + Cities's</em> Cover Art</figcaption>
                        </div>

                        <h4>Preiconographic: Text</h4>

                        <p>On the preiconograpich level, which focuses on the literal meaning (Serafini, 2011), is the cover art's text. This information is expected to need no further interpretation, and because of genre standards, the audience expects text on the cover art to be visually clear and to portray the title of the podcast. Successful use of text on the cover art acts as an appeal to ethos by showing that the podcast is aware of the genre's standards, thus improving its credibility.</p>

                        <p>All three examples emphasize the text by using a color that contrasts with the background (Arola et al, 2014), making this aspect visually clear. <em>99% Invisible</em> (Figure 1) and <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> (Figure 2) show the names of their podcasts, while <em>A History of Architecture</em> (Figure 3) shows the podcastâ€™s website. <em>A History of Architecture's</em> use of text may confuse the audience, since the text it displays contradicts what is expected according to the genre's conventions and therefore fails to fulfill its rhetorical purpose.</p>

                        <h4>Iconographic: Architectural Reference</h4>

                        <p>The iconographic level, focusing on visual connotation (Serafini, 2011), relates to the graphic's reference to architecture. This too appeals to ethos by showing that the podcast knows of architectural iconography.</p>

                        <p><em>99% Invisible's</em> cover art utilizes a visual grid, which many associate with architecture. <em>A History of Architecture</em> uses geometric diagrams, playing on the technical associations that architecture is prone to have. The cover art for <em>About Buildings + Cities</em> uses a literal approach by using an image of a building as its background. Although architecture does have associations with geometry, <em>A History of Architecture</em> runs the risk of referencing a different genre altogether. A viewer could accidentally mistake this cover art to belong to a podcast about math. In this case, the podcast has failed to fully consider the connotations that the audience may have with the imagery used in the cover art, and as a result has failed to complete its rhetorical purpose.</p>

                        <h4>Iconological: Design Style</h4>

                        <p>The iconological level requires viewers to interpret the underlying ideology of the visual medium (Serafini, 2011). For this genre's cover art, this comes in the form of the overall design style. The audience expects the cover art to have a minimalist, contemporary design to signifiy clarity, sophistication, and familiarity with current design trends. This is an appeal to ethos, because successfully aligning to the genre's expectations in this area make the podcast seem more trustworthy in how it will discuss architectural topics.</p>

                        <p>All three podcasts have fairly simplistic designs, though <em>99% Invisible's</em> and <em>About Buildings + Cities'</em> color palettes are more limited, giving a more minimalist feeling. Additionally, the colors for these two podcasts are more contemporary and in line with current design trends, whereas the colors for <em>A History of Architecture</em> imply a more dated design aesthetic. This communicates that <em>A History of Architecture</em> may be less clear and sophisticated than the other two podcasts.</p>
