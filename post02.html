                    <p>There are two types of cats in this world: the friendly, sociable cat who takes advantage of their charismatic nature to get what they want; the skittish, distrusting cat who hides away in fear and glares at those who pass by. Mr. Bennett is the latter. It’s a curious situation, really, as he started out as a very adventurous kitten. He hated staying in one place and was the first to escape the confines of the box in which he and his littermates were originally kept.</p>

                    <p>Today, Mr. Bennett still holds a deep displeasure for being held in one place for more than fifteen seconds, but he seems to have lost his sense of adventure that was once so prominent. Most of his day is spent curled up with the springs inside of the couch, or, on special occasions, within the box spring in my bedroom. It’s remarkable how difficult it is to get a decent picture of him (due to the fact that he never sits still), which is why the image provided is a drawing.</p>
